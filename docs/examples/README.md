## Hello World

This is the a classical *Hello World* example:

::: example hello-world
<<< @/components/demo/hello-world.vue
:::

::: tip
The example above is not using any theme or custom styles. For this reason it looks like a bit boring. Most of the following examples are using a theme.

## Close on Click Inside

This example shows you how to add a *close*-button inside the popover.

::: example click-inside
<<< @/components/demo/click-inside.vue
:::

## Show on Hover

{{ $page.lib }} is very flexible: This example shows how to show the popover on `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`. The result is a very simple tooltip.

::: example custom-trigger
<<< @/components/demo/custom-trigger.vue
:::
